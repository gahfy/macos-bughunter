# macOS BugHunter

This repository aims to install bug hunting tools from sources on macOS with
Apple Silicon Chips.

This is for now just a personal repo, that you can use as you wish, but without
any support provided.

Installing XCode is required.
After installing XCode, run those commands.

```
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app
sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
```
